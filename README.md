Explore a maze where you can collect different items. To enter the temple, you must first collect the key and then interacting with the door. To collect items and interact with the door, view the item with your cardboard and then click on them. 

There are cubes scattered around the maze - these are waypoints. This is how the user will move through the maze. They become highlighted when the user looks at them - and when clicked they play a sound and move the user to their location (either by motion or teleportation.)
